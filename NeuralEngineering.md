Neural engineering (also known as neuroengineering) is a discipline within biomedical engineering that uses engineering techniques to understand, repair, replace, or enhance neural systems. Neural engineers are uniquely qualified to solve design problems at the interface of living neural tissue and non-living constructs  (Hetling, 2008).

#### Fundamentals
The fundamentals behind neuroengineering involve the relationship of neurons, neural networks, and nervous system functions to quantifiable models to aid the development of devices that could interpret and control signals and produce purposeful responses.

#### Neuroscience
Messages that the body uses to influence thoughts, senses, movements, and survival are directed by nerve impulses transmitted across brain tissue and to the rest of the body. Neurons are the basic functional unit of the nervous system and are highly specialized cells that are capable of sending these signals that operate high and low level functions needed for survival and quality of life. Neurons have special electro-chemical properties that allow them to process information and then transmit that information to other cells. Neuronal activity is dependent upon neural membrane potential and the changes that occur along and across it. A constant voltage, known as the membrane potential, is normally maintained by certain concentrations of specific ions across neuronal membranes. Disruptions or variations in this voltage create an imbalance, or polarization, across the membrane. Depolarization of the membrane past its threshold potential generates an action potential, which is the main source of signal transmission, known as neurotransmission of the nervous system. An action potential results in a cascade of ion flux down and across an axonal membrane, creating an effective voltage spike train or "electrical signal" which can transmit further electrical changes in other cells. Signals can be generated by electrical, chemical, magnetic, optical, and other forms of stimuli that influence the flow of charges, and thus voltage levels across neural membranes (He 2005).

#### Engineering
Engineers employ quantitative tools that can be used for understanding and interacting with complex neural systems. Methods of studying and generating chemical, electrical, magnetic, and optical signals responsible for extracellular field potentials and synaptic transmission in neural tissue aid researchers in the modulation of neural system activity (Babb et al. 2008). To understand properties of neural system activity, engineers use signal processing techniques and computational modeling (Eliasmith & Anderson 2003). To process these signals, neural engineers must translate the voltages across neural membranes into corresponding code, a process known as neural coding. Neural coding studies on how the brain encodes simple commands in the form of central pattern generators (CPGs), movement vectors, the cerebellar internal model, and somatotopic maps to understand movement and sensory phenomena. Decoding of these signals in the realm of neuroscience is the process by which neurons understand the voltages that have been transmitted to them. Transformations involve the mechanisms that signals of a certain form get interpreted and then translated into another form. Engineers look to mathematically model these transformations (Eliasmith & Anderson 2003). There are a variety of methods being used to record these voltage signals. These can be intracellular or extracellular. Extracellular methods involve single-unit recordings, extracellular field potentials, and amperometry; more recently, multielectrode arrays have been used to record and mimic signals.

#### Abstract
> Within the mammalian nervous system, billions of neurons connected by quadrillions of synapses exchange electrical, chemical and mechanical signals. Disruptions to this network manifest as neurological or psychiatric conditions. Despite decades of neuroscience research, our ability to treat or even to understand these conditions is limited by the tools capable of probing the signalling complexity of the nervous system. Although orders of magnitude smaller and computationally faster than neurons, conventional substrate-bound electronics do not address the chemical and mechanical properties of neural tissue. This mismatch results in a foreign-body response and the encapsulation of devices by glial scars, suggesting that the design of an interface between the nervous system and a synthetic sensor requires additional materials innovation. Advances in genetic tools for manipulating neural activity have fuelled the demand for devices capable of simultaneous recording and controlling individual neurons at unprecedented scales. Recently, flexible organic electronics and bio- and nanomaterials have been developed for multifunctional and minimally invasive probes for long-term interaction with the nervous system. In this Review, we discuss the design lessons from the quarter-century-old field of neural engineering, highlight recent materials-driven progress in neural probes, and look at emergent directions inspired by the principles of neural transduction.

#### Introduction
> Understanding the information transfer and processing within the mammalian nervous system is one of the most urgent challenges faced by the biomedical community. Neurological, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and neuromuscular conditions, for example, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, major depressive disorder, and multiple sclerosis, respectively, affect an ever-increasing percentage of our aging population (Fig. 1a–b) [1–3], and traumatic injuries to the nervous system contribute 2.4 million patients each year to the disability burden in the US alone [4]. Furthermore, inflammatory conditions, such as hypertension and arthritis, have been linked to changes in peripheral nerve activity [5]. Although basic neuroscience research of the past century has greatly advanced our understanding of neuronal function, the ability to record and manipulate the dynamics of the nervous system remains insufficient to treat these psychiatric and neurological disorders or to restore function following nerve injury.

> Within the 1.3 litre volume of the human brain, billions of neurons, divided into thousands of genetically and structurally defined subtypes, communicate with each other through quadrillions of synapses (Fig. 1d–g) [6]. Notably, neurons represent only ~50% of the cells in the brain. The other half are electrically inactive glia that include astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia,[7] the roles of which in brain function remains an active area of research [8, 9]. Similarly, the ~45-cm long, 1.5-cm thick spinal cord encompasses a variety of motor and interneurons, Schwann cells, and neuronal processes connecting the brain to the >150,000 km web of the peripheral nervous system [10] (FIG. 1h–j).

> Neural activity is marked by millisecond-long 80–100 mV spikes in cell-membrane voltage called action potentials [6]. Aided by voltage-sensitive ion channels, action potentials propagate across neural membranes to release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitter uptake by the dendrites of synaptic partners results in signal transduction. In addition to chemical and electrical signals, neurons can respond to physical stimuli, such as pH [11], temperature [12, 13], pressure and tension [14] mediated by a variety of ion channels. Understanding neural function hence requires tools that can communicate with neurons across the diversity of their signaling capacities.

> Driven by Moore’s law over the past 25 years, miniaturization of electronic devices down to the nanoscale has delivered unprecedented computational power. Although neuroprosthetic research has undoubtedly benefitted from these advances, additional design parameters need to be included for effective long-term operation and clinical translation of neural interfaces. The complexity of neural tissue requires further materials innovation beyond microfabricated semiconductor circuits. Consideration of the brain’s mechanical, electrical and chemical properties, and the diversity of neural signaling pathways may guide materials design to establish intimate long-term synthetic interfaces capable of faithful recording and stimulation of neural activity.

### History of neural engineering
#### From neuroscience to neural engineering.
> Motivation to answer fundamental questions in neuroscience has consistently inspired the invention of new technologies (FIG. 2). In the 1950s, wires were introduced to measure electrical activity in the nervous system [15], followed by patch-clamp electrophysiology in the 1970s [16] to elucidate synaptic transmission. In the 1980s to 1990s, silicon multielectrode arrays [17, 18], and stereotrodes and tetrodes [19, 20] have been developed to investigate communication between large groups of neurons within distinct neural circuits.

> These probe innovations relied on tailoring device geometry and electrical impedance to a particular neuroscience application. For extracellular recordings, the impedance is determined by the capacitive characteristics of the interface between the electrode and the cerebro-spinal fluid, which is a function of the electrode material and the tip area. High-impedance electrodes (5–10 MΩ) are typically used to record action potentials with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR > 20) from neurons within a 10-μm radius [21]. Insulated steel, tungsten, gold and platinum microwires with dimensions of approximately 10–100 μm and impedances of less than 1 MΩ are commonly employed for extracellular recordings from moderate numbers of neurons [22]. Stereotrodes and tetrodes consist of 2 or 4 polymer-insulated 12-μm nickel–chromium (NiCr) microwires that are electrochemically coated with gold to lower the impedance from about 1–3 MΩ to 100–500 kΩ and to improve biochemical stability [19, 20]. The close proximity of multiple microwires enables deconvolution of overlapping population signals to identify action-potential shapes corresponding to specific cells via principal component analysis [23]. Neurotrophic electrodes integrate a microwire within a pipette carrying neurotrophic factors that stimulate neuronal ingrowth for high-fidelity recordings [24].

#### Microfabricated neural probes.
> By the 1980s, advances in semiconductor microfabrication led to the development of silicon-based multielectrode arrays known as Utah arrays [17] and Michigan probes [18]. Utah arrays, which contain up to 128 sharp, metal-tipped electrodes with a pitch of 200–400 μm, are produced by a combination of micromachining and lithography from thick silicon wafers. Implanted Utah arrays ‘float’ on the surface of the brain and are connected to skull-mounted interface boards by flexible cables. Due to their relatively large area and electrode count, these devices have become crucial components in studies of cortical circuits in non-human primates and are the only neural probes approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for chronic use in human patients [25]. As Utah arrays only permit recordings from the topmost 1–3 mm of the cortex with large footprints limiting their utility in small animal models, alternative strategies have been designed for monitoring neural activity at different spatial scales. Michigan probes are composed of lithographically defined patterns of metallic electrodes on thin silicon substrates for depth-defined recordings in subcortical structures [26]. Compatibility of these designs with modern CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) processing enables straightforward integration of data acquisition and signal amplification capabilities while allowing for facile back-end connectorization [27, 28]. Both Utah arrays and Michigan probes employ the polymers polyimide and parylene C for insulation. Powered by advances in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication, the past three decades of neural engineering have delivered a multitude of sophisticated probes inspired by Utah and Michigan designs with increased resolution, reduced dimensions and expanded capabilities [29].

> The emergence of the fields of neuroprosthetics and brain–machine interfaces, which seek to restore voluntary motor control to paralyzed patients, necessitated the development of high-resolution recording probes. By the late 1990s, decoding algorithms were developed to control robotic joints using rodent and primate brain activity in real time [30, 31]. The surge of scientific and clinical enthusiasm around brain–machine interfaces propelled this technology into clinical trials in 2004, producing encouraging demonstrations of tetraplegic patients controlling computer cursors [25] and robotic arms [32] with implanted electrode arrays. However, maintaining high SNR recordings from thousands of neurons proved challenging, and biocompatibility and reliability issues often resulted in probe failure only a few weeks after implantation [29, 33, 34].
