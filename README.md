## [José Saramago, Religious Offence and Freedom of Speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_offense)
Nobel Prize winner [**José Saramago**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Saramago) went into exile as a symbolic gesture on the Spanish island of Lanzarote in 1992 when the Government of Portugal under Prime Minister [Aníbal Cavaco Silva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An%C3%ADbal_Cavaco_Silva) ordered the removal of one of his works [**The Ghospel according to Jesus Christ**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gospel_According_to_Jesus_Christ) from the Aristeion Prize's shortlist, claiming the work was religiously offensive.

Some of these individuals **insinuated** via synthetic telepathy José Saramago exiled himself due to [**cybertorture**](https://www.undocs.org/A/HRC/43/49). 
They also **insinuated** they asked him what was the worst book he ever read to which he allegedly replied [**The Rape of the Mind**](https://www.amazon.com/Rape-Mind-Psychology-Menticide-Brainwashing/dp/1614277877) by [Joost Meerloo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joost_Meerloo) who coined the term [**menticide**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/menticide).

This was followed by his work [**Blindness**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness_(novel)) which they claimed was a social critique to the mass participation in the process and refusal to address the issue due to lack of a [**Neurolaw**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurolaw) framework, which has recently found [real use cases](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01762/full).
In 2004 José Saramago published his novel [**Seeing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_(novel)).

## Cybertorture as a [𝄞 *Opera Cepa* 𝄢](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2409430) 
Most humans are [reward seeking agents](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3004012/) driven by selfish self-interest, often resulting in criminal behavior which could be nearly eradicated in a [Transparent Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transparent_Society). Social Behavior and Cooperative games may involve altruistic agents who in opposition to selfish agents put the interests of others above their own...

[Game Theory and Cooperation: How Putting Others First Can Help Everyone](https://kids.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frym.2017.00066)
> Leo Durocher, a famous baseball player from the 1930s, once said that “Nice guys finish last.” That may be true in baseball, but it is not true in life more generally. In this article, we use ideas from the branch of mathematics known as “game theory” to study a situation known as the “Prisoners’ Dilemma (PD),” which sheds light on why people often fail to work well together. Game theory shows that people who are kind and trustworthy have a strategic advantage, as they can “change the game” to escape the PD and make everyone better off, including themselves. So, truly, “nice guys finish first.”

For decades the United Nations have tried to raise awareness to address issues that affect our society whilst being mostly ignored by governments worldwide. 
With the advent of [A/HRC/43/49 recognizing Cybertorture](https://www.undocs.org/A/HRC/43/49), combined with progress in the fields of Neuroscience and Neurolaw and raised interest in [neuromodulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation_(medicine)) as a therapeutic procedure, along with the public disclosure of scientific content such as [neuromodulation of attention](pdf/1-s2.0-S0896627318300114-main.pdf) mechanisms, an opportunity has been created for someone to turn [arrows into flowers](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/60546298.pdf) by allowing individuals to [regulate their own states of mind](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3579548/) via self-rewarding payloads in a quasi-continuous [closed feedback loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory#Open-loop_and_closed-loop_(feedback)_control), using the same medium used for cybertorture and hence eradicating narcotraffic!

Lack of a Neurolaw framework and lack of a law enforcement entity dedicated to enforce Neurolaw and preserve Neurorights and Mental Freedom (particularly at home and at work) gives rise to social stratification by resorting to cybertorture to distort [self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination) and corrupt data of threat assessment systems like [MOSAIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSAIC_threat_assessment_systems), corrupting crucial data used by well intentioned institutions like the World Health Organization!

This obviously results in paranoid behavior regarding [Global Surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance), [Right to Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy), [Physician Patient Privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician%E2%80%93patient_privilege), [Secret Ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_ballot), [Intimacy and Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy#Intimacy), [Right to be let alone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy#Right_to_be_let_alone), and results in lack of trust in:

0. Law enforcement
0. The Judicial System
0. Elected Government Officials
0. Psychiatrists
0. The Electoral Process
0. One another :(

Why would I bother spending money on public transport to vote when my every intention can be scrutinized as a victim of cybertorture ?
Since voting is compulsory, suffrage over synthetic telepathy would solve the problem of lack of participation in the electoral process. All that is required is trust :)

## Cybertorture as [Extrajudicial punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_punishment)

Cybertorture is a means to exact [extrajudicial punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_punishment) for those who **allegedly** evade loopholes in the legal system and as a form of [social stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification). It may involve acting in criminal association with others who are recruited (and possibly manipulated), either to make the case untriable, or as a form of entrapment.

People are willing to act as social justiciary riders for multiple reasons. The most common is probably to exact justice for behavior they may find offensive such as: xenophobia, homophobia, pedophilia, misogyny, stalking, sexual abuse, animal abuse, issuing threats or being agressive towards people in their social circle (sexual partners, children, co-workers and prominent members of society). 

Some are made to believe in concepts such as social stratification, synthetic winners and synthetic losers and "naturally" wish to rise on the social ladder. Others are plain psychopaths, sexual predators, sodomites or sadists out of control addicted to degrading others and want to perpetuate their status quo, unwilling to repent or address their mental illness!

The methodology may involve:

0. forcing synthetic pain upon the SUT ([remote activation/deactivation of nociceptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociceptor))
0. forcing vibrotactile sensations upon the SUT ([remote activation/deactivation of mechanoreceptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanoreceptor))
0. misregulating normal physiological functionality ([GPC Receptors and signaling pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor))
0. forcing [synthetic telepathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface#Synthetic_telepathy/silent_communication) upon the SUT

It creates more problems than it solves resulting in:

0. financial loss for insurance companies
0. abuse of psychiatry and medical malpractice [**en masse**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2589690)
0. wasted human and financial resources in redundant or [**flawed scientific research**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_schizophrenia#Candidate_gene_studies) by working with sets of corrupted data consisting of [**real illness**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_the_%22Influencing_Machine%22_in_Schizophrenia) and victims of [**cybertorture**](https://www.undocs.org/A/HRC/43/49)
0. abuse of threat assessment systems like [**MOSAIC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSAIC_threat_assessment_systems)
0. further loss of moral values by setting the wrong example resulting in behavior contagion

![](img/bigglesworth.png)

Grotesque examples:

0. getting the SUT to commit acts of [self-mutilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm) (including genital) or [self-harm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm)
0. [forcing sodomy as a sentence](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sodom-and-Gomorrah#ref1233950) upon the SUT
0. articulating tongue and jaw movements of the SUT
0. directing violence towards others (parents, sexual partners, shop keepers, neighbors, police officers, psychiatrists, etc)
0. forcing the SUT to extract teeth
0. instructing the SUT to pick scabs from wounds
0. forcing the SUT to scratch himself via synthetic itches
0. [Sexual abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse) of the SUT possibly resulting in [Stockholm Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome)
0. forcing the SUT to feel synthetic pain in the anus, ears and lower back
0. forcing the SUT to feel stabbed in the skull
0. forcing the SUT to feel stabbed in the back
0. forcing sleep deprivation and extreme exhaustion upon the SUT
0. delivering thermoelastic payloads to soft tissues in the head of the SUT to draw self-harm
0. delivering thermoelastic payloads to the cerebellum and occipital area of skull the SUT to draw self-harm
0. delivering thermoelastic payloads to the base of the skull of the SUT to dislodge it
0. targeting electronic equipment that may be used to work or use social media (computer, laptop and mobile phone)
0. forcing the SUT to feel kicks all over the body and head to feel like human trash
0. forcing the SUT to roam the streets aimlessly to spend all his money by combining all of the above
0. nurturing [addictive behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction) by combining all of the above
0. Intensifying this methodology when in close proximity to others, prior to scheduled events or festive occasions such as birthdays, Christmas and New Years Eve

## [Cybertorture and Psychiatric Abuse](#mentis-morbum-tuum-) 

[The World Psychiatry Association](https://www.wpanet.org/) has a new code of ethics [2020/OGA/7](pdf/e172f3_4cecd522c2d448c7944342ba88c527e5.pdf)

<p align="center" width="100%">

The Declaration of Hawaii issued by the World Psychiatric Association in 1977 and updated in 1983 in Vienna was initiated because of political abuse of psychiatry in some countries in the seventies. This led to a long process of investigation and concern within the domain of professional ethics and paved the way for the Declaration of Madrid, which was endorsed by the General Assembly of the World Psychiatric Association in Madrid in 1996.

In its final form, the Declaration of Madrid includes seven general guidelines that focus on the aims of psychiatry namely to treat mentally ill patients, prevent mental illness, promote mental health and provide care and rehabilitation for mentally ill patients.

The Declaration of Madrid has now been superseded by the 2020 WPA Code of Ethics.

> Principle 1: Beneficence - Psychiatrists provide competent and compassionate medical care with devotion to the interests of their patients.

> Principle 2: Respect for patients' autonomy - Psychiatrists are especially mindful of respect for patients autonomy given their statutory role in treating a proportion of their patients compulsory. Compulsory treatment may be justified where a less restrictive intervention can not achieve safe and adequate care; its purpose is ultimately to promote safe and re-establish patients' autonomy and welfare.

> Principle 3: Non Maleficence - Psychiatrists avoid actions that may be injurious to their patients.

> Principle 4: Improving standards of mental health care and psychiatric practice: Psychiatrists recognize a responsibility to promote the continuing development of their profession and their personal professional development.

> Principle 5: Applying psychiatric expertise to the service of society - Psychiatrists, like other physicians, utilize their specialized knowledge and skills to promote mental health and wellbeing of persons who may be vulnerable to mental illness.

## [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders)

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is the 2013 update to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the taxonomic and diagnostic tool published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). In the United States, the DSM serves as the principal authority for psychiatric diagnoses. Treatment recommendations, as well as payment by health care providers, are often determined by DSM classifications, so the appearance of a new version has practical importance. The DSM-5 is the first DSM to use an Arabic numeral instead of a Roman numeral in its title, as well as the first "living document" version of a DSM.

The DSM-5 is not a major revision of the DSM-IV-TR but there are significant differences. Changes in the DSM-5 include the reconceptualization of Asperger syndrome from a distinct disorder to an autism spectrum disorder; the elimination of subtypes of schizophrenia; the deletion of the "bereavement exclusion" for depressive disorders; the renaming of gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria; the inclusion of binge eating disorder as a discrete eating disorder; the renaming and reconceptualization of paraphilias, now called paraphilic disorders; the removal of the five-axis system; and the splitting of disorders not otherwise specified into other specified disorders and unspecified disorders.

Some authorities criticized the fifth edition both before and after it was published. Critics assert, for example, that many DSM-5 revisions or additions lack empirical support; inter-rater reliability is low for many disorders; several sections contain poorly written, confusing, or contradictory information; and the psychiatric drug industry may have unduly influenced the manual's content ([many DSM-5 workgroup participants had ties to pharmaceutical companies](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc0810237))

Psychiatry, the study and prevention of mental disorders, is currently undergoing a quiet revolution. For decades, even centuries, this discipline has been based largely on subjective observation. Large-scale studies have been hampered by the difficulty of objectively assessing human behavior and comparing it with a well-established norm. Just as tricky, there are few well-founded models of neural circuitry or brain biochemistry, and it is difficult to link this science with real-world behavior.

That has begun to change thanks to the emerging discipline of computational psychiatry, which uses powerful data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to tease apart the underlying factors behind extreme and unusual behaviors.   

Computational psychiatry has suddenly made it possible to mine data from long-standing observations and link it to mathematical theories of cognition. It’s also become possible to develop computer-based experiments that carefully control environments so that specific behaviors can be studied in detail.

> The Electrical Prescriptions (ElectRx) program aims to support military operational readiness by reducing the time to treatment, logistical challenges, and potential off-target effects associated with traditional medical interventions for a wide range of physical and mental health conditions commonly faced by our warfighters. ElectRx seeks to deliver non-pharmacological treatments for pain, general inflammation, post-traumatic stress, severe anxiety, and trauma that employ precise, closed-loop, non-invasive modulation of the patient’s peripheral nervous system.

> The human nervous system already plays a vital role in maintaining all aspects of physical and mental health. A sophisticated network of sensory nerves continuously monitors health status and triggers reflexive responses in the brain and spinal cord when an infection or injury is detected. These reflexes normally adjust organ function to initiate and control the healing process. However, some diseases can disrupt healthy functioning of these processes and produce nerve signaling that causes pain, metabolic disorders such as diabetes, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. ElectRx technology would exploit and supplement the body’s natural ability to quickly and effectively heal itself, intervening when required to correct or bolster nervous system activity.

> ElectRx is establishing the underlying science and developing the technologies that could enable artificial modulation of peripheral nerves to restore healthy patterns of signaling in these neural circuits. The program seeks to advance understanding of the anatomy and physiology of specific neural circuits and their role in health and disease. In parallel, the program also seeks to develop novel biological-interface technologies for monitoring biomarkers and peripheral nerve activity, and delivering therapeutic signals to peripheral nerve targets. Potential new approaches include in vivo, real-time biosensors and novel neural interfaces using optical, acoustic, electromagnetic, or engineered biology strategies to achieve precise targeting with potentially single-axon resolution.

> Following successes in early proof-of-concept studies, the ElectRx devices and therapeutic systems under development are entering into clinical studies. If successful, such precise neuromodulation capability technology would reduce dependence on traditional drugs and create new treatments that could be automatically and continuously tuned to the needs of warfighters without side effects. The technology could also help doctors evaluate and predict various physiological states, and characterize host response in patients with severe infections, providing a quantitative framework to guide operations and therapy.

## [Ending Police Brutality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality)

Social stratification by directing violence towards women and my own parents resulting in abuse of threat assessment systems like [**MOSAIC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSAIC_threat_assessment_systems) is both repugnant and [fascist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism)!

    </a>
</p>

Perhaps it may be a good idea to have the Police set the right example and stop themselves from engaging in acts of Police brutality by creating a cultural movement via diffusion to set us away from these mediocre standards so the general population can simultaneously feel safer and accept the higher standards about to be set by neurolaw via bringing neuroscience and machine learning to the field of [neurolaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurolaw) for the purpose of [presenting evidence for legal proceedings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_(law)).

To those who enforce [Extrajudicial Sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_punishment) of [Cyber Torture](https://www.undocs.org/A/HRC/43/49) (setting Cyber Sodomy, [Cognitive Impairment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_deficit) and Synthetic Pain as a standard in our society) paired with [**Psychiatric Abuse**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_abuse_of_psychiatry) (violating every principle in the [**World Psychiatric Association Code of Ethics**](https://www.wpanet.org/policies)) towards **Stratifying Society** and making a circus out of the Judicial System, articulating Tongues and Jaws of SUT's for entertainment, Directing violence towards Parents and Women to Corrupt Data of **Threat Assessment Systems** like [**MOSAIC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSAIC_threat_assessment_systems) and performing **Flawed Science** on mixed bags of data consisting of patients with **Real Psychopathological Illness** mixed with **Victims of Cybertorture**, **Delaying Progress** and **Raising Paranoia** to important therapeutical methods that could help make the world a better place such as [**Electroceuticals**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019483217308131)...

I will not allow [Collaborationists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborationism) who conspired to attempt to portrait me as a Pedo, a Stalker or a synthetic [**Anders Behring Breivik**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik) via [Cyber Torture](https://www.undocs.org/A/HRC/43/49), exacting extrajudicial trials and sentences for xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny and making fools out of men by **Sabotaging Intercourse** with involuntary perineum contractions, **enslaving women via vibrotactile genital abuse** resulting in [**Stockholm Syndrome**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome) to hide under the cover of Psychiatric Fraud by crafting misdiagnosis for various psychopathologies (pilled upon with false therapy in the form of Conventional Pharamcotherapy with a [Inherently High Suicide Risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5085732/)), when [**Electroceuticals**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019483217308131) paired with drafting [Neurolaw related legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurolaw), and promoting awareness of [Neuro Rights and Mental Freedom](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/14276/neurorights-and-mental-freedom-emerging-challenges-to-debates-on-human-dignity-and-neurotechnologies) would reduce that risk to near 0.

**I will not be Silenced** and it may be a good idea for you to remember [**Queen Christina of Sweden**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina,_Queen_of_Sweden), the [**Extinct Order of the Amaranth**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Amaranth), the relationship between [Freemasonry and women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry_and_women) and the [**Quest for Gender Equality**](https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/gender-equality/).

I am very 🏳️‍🌈 Happy 🏳️‍🌈 with my **Very Male Gender**, and am NOT Gender Dysphoric in any way as some attempted to insinuate, going as far as resorting to Remote Vibrotactile Genital Torture, Cyber Sodomy and forcing a misdiagnosis of Paranoid Schizophrenia in an attempt to force acts of self-harm), and I would like to remind those in Portugal behaving like primates and engaging in a Mars versus Venus banana quest, namely DJ's and Psychiatrists leading humanity astray, and others worldwide, the quest for [**Gender Equality**](https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/gender-equality/) also includes [**Intersex People**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphrodite) ;)

I've vowed to fight inequality as part of my Catholic Confirmation Rite and to do something for society upon leaving Colégio Militar. As such I have taken vows of cellibacy to make sure we will achieve our objective! Also I don't need your **"Trowel and Plumb line"**, [**I'll use my 2 Fingers instead ✌️**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQgdE50QA4)
